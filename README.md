Every scripts which can be usefull will be posted here.

Keep in mind that none of these scripts are considered perfect.

So please help me to improve them.


### rename-files.py

  This script will help you to rename your files and directory by removing file, renaming and changing from regexs or strings, and so on.

  The recursive renaming is not really accurate you will need to execute it multiple time to be sure to rename everything ( particularly if you have a directory which needs to be renamed too.) This point needs improvements.
